# Finite State Machine
This is an exercise understanding the Finite State Machine, please read below before looking at the code:

## Set up
This repository uses Python (version 3.10 or higher would be ideal, but 3.3+ should be sufficient) and nothing else.

To run the script, type `python run.py`. You DO NOT need to do anything with `main.py`, though you are free to open it up and play around with it.

## Tests
To run all of the unit tests, in this current directory, run `python -m unittest discover` in your console of choice.

## Notes
Normally when I comment code I don't write as much as I did for this repository. I wrote a lot in this case as I felt it was really important to illustrate my thought process for everything.
